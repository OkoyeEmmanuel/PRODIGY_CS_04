# PRODIGY_CS_04

This project is part of my task-based cybersecurity internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The goal was to build a **basic keylogger program** that records and logs keystrokes. Focusing on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. 

## How It Works
1. The program listens for keyboard input.  
2. Captured keystrokes are written into a log file.  
3. The script stops automatically after 15 seconds.  


## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3  
- VS Code  
- GitHub Desktop
